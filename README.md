# Quant-Exam-Perfomance-Analytics

# # Analysing the effectiveness of Tests in mathematics and portugeese of students.
# 
# ### The term 'effectiveness' can be interpreted into a broad spectrum of analysis, hence we have come up with the following metrics which we believe to be the best representatives of the effectiveness.
# 
# #### [1] C Score Analysis : The tests have a passing score and a consider score, if a student is unable to obtain the passing score, but have achieved the consider score then, the teacher manually assess his/her profile and let them pass. Hence we have analysed to the percentage of students who have passed in total and analysed what percentage passed through the consider score and passing score to examine the difficulty of the test
# 
# 
# #### [2] Percentage Distribution: An analysis which shows the percentage breakup of scores for each tests. The percentage break up of scores are the following '0-10%', '10-20%', '20-30%', '30-40%', '40-50%', '50-60%', '60-70%', '70-80%', '80-90%' and  '90-100% Then the percentage of candidates who fills under the above score groups are listed. This analysis shows the spectrum of candidate scores 
# 
# 
# #### [3] Normal Distribution Analysis: The scores obtained by every candidate of all tests are fit onto a normal distribution to analyze the skewness of data. This analysis shows that a left-skewed plot represents a difficult test and a right skewed plot represents an easy test
# 
# #### [4] Question level difficulty analysis : This analysis shows for each test the breakup of correct and incorrect responses for each question, and the questions where the number of incorrect reponses was remarkably large are highlighted.
# 
# #### [5] Too long tests : Analysing the relative amount of questions in each tests, that were skipped by more than 15% of the candidates of each tests.
# 
# ### ASSUMPTIONS MADE
# The tests for which the passing score was not given,it was assumed to be 70%. 
# The tests for which the consider score was not given,it was assumed to be 60%.
